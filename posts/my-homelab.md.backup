## Humble beginnings
In 2015, My "homelab" started out as a 2011 Dell Inspiron hosting a Minecraft server running Windows 8. I vividly remember being beyond confused at why I could connect to the server locally no problem but my friends couldn't join over the internet. 12 year old Sytriz didn't quite understand what port forwarding was yet...

Its fair to say I have came a long way since then. My homelab has evolved with my needs as I've grown up and expanded my technical skill set. Today my homelab is finally at a state where I feel that sharing my setup and configuration details could potentially help beginners get started and/or inspired.

## My homelab today

Today, my homelab consists mainly of two servers. Both these servers are running Proxmox as a hypervisor which hosts virtual machines and containers. I'm hosting loads of different applications that provide a wide range of services. Including everything from media management to financial software.

## Future plans
Knowing everything I know now, if I were to restart, there would be lots of things I would do differently. Within the next couple of months I will be moving, and I'm going to use this as an excuse to completely redo my homelab.

Say goodbye to the days of repurposed hardware with 4th gen intel processors and DDR3! I am planning to build an all-in-one overkill server to host everything I need. I plan for this server to have a Xeon or EPYC processor with load of cores, boatloads of ECC memory, and an array of storage.

Stay tuned for updates on my homelab journey. I'm sure there will be much more to come!
